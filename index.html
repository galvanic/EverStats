	<h2 id="viz">Visualising my Evernote history</h2> <!-- Meh, need better title -->
	<p>
		It's been a while since I've used Evernote. I got nostalgic, and wanted to see how I've used it over the past few months.
		I'm particularly interested in seeing if there's some sort of pattern in the times I read certain tags, notably the feminist tag.
		I assumed it would have been quite high last year, peaking during certain months and decreasing majorly since September this year.
		Let's see if I'm right.
	</p>

		Looking at my history, it looks like I started working on this project again on the 29th of November. I'd had the idea earlier in the term,
		and it had seemed complicated at the time (asking for a key<!-- link -->) what with video tutorials with titles like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEn-G_jyM2A">"Python + Evernote - <strong>Advanced</strong> API Workshop"</a>
